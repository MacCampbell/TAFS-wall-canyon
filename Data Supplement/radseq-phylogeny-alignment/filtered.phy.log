Host:    Macs-MBP-2 (AVX, 16 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s filtered.phy -st DNA -m MFP+ASC -bb 1000 -alrt 1000 -redo
Seed:    740958 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Apr 14 12:38:07 2022
Kernel:  AVX - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file filtered.phy ... Phylip format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 107 sequences with 8248 columns, 8145 distinct patterns
7330 parsimony-informative, 838 singleton sites, 80 constant sites
